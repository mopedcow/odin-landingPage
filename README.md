Odin Project: Landing Page
Goals: put together everything I've learned about Flexbox and everything else thus far in the course.

Result summary: It was not difficult putting together a website that is
close to the example using skills learned in the course. The only big
difficulties I encountered happened when I was trying to do something
complicated/outside the scope of the lesson. That's fine.
